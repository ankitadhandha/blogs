 - [[wheat]] is a grass widely cultivated for its seed, a cereal grain which is a worldwide staple food. 
 - There are many species of wheat which together make up the genus Triticum; the most widely grown is common wheat (T. aestivum). 
 - Wheat is grown on more land area than any other food crop. World trade in wheat is greater than for all other crops combined. 
 - Globally, wheat is the leading source of vegetal protein in human food, having a protein content of about 13%, which is relatively high compared to other major cereals and staple foods. 
 - When eaten as the whole grain, wheat is a source of multiple nutrients and dietary fiber, and is associated with lower risk of several diseases, including coronary heart disease, stroke, cancer and type 2 diabetes. 
 - In a small part of the general population, gluten - the major part of wheat protein - can trigger coeliac disease, non-coeliac gluten sensitivity, gluten ataxia and dermatitis herpetiformis. 
 - AFDSI created a Wheat Ontology.
